## Troubleshooting

### If you see old fields or errors:
1. **Check database migration:** Make sure both SQL files were executed
2. **Clear browser cache:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check console:** Look for any TypeScript or API errors
4. **Verify data:** Check if mock data was inserted properly

### If navigation doesn't work:
1. **Check routes:** Ensure `/customers/[id]` route exists
2. **Check imports:** Verify all components are properly imported
3. **Check authentication:** Make sure you're logged in

### If styling looks broken:
1. **Check Tailwind:** Ensure all CSS classes are loading
2. **Check icons:** Verify Heroicons are imported correctly
3. **Check layout:** Ensure DashboardLayout is working

## Sample URLs to Test
- Customer List: `http://localhost:3000/customers`
- Customer View: `http://localhost:3000/customers/[any-customer-id]`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

The customer view now shows comprehensive information about each customer with proper organization and navigation! üéâ
